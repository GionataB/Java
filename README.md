This repository contains programs written using Java.
In each folder there will be a README.md file with more explanations on the program.

Every class comes with comments: while I did not generate javadocs for all of them, it is easy to generate them.

Since most, or all, of these projects were originally done as class projects, some interface files are not mine. However, mine is the implementation of the actual classes.
