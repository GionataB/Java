This repository contains programs written using Java.
In each folder there will be a README.md file with more explanations on the program.

Every class comes with comments: I will generate the javadocs files in the future.

Since most, or all, of these projects were originally done as class projects, the interfaces are not mine. However, mine is the implementation of the actual classes.

For further information, check the comments and javadocs of each class/project.
